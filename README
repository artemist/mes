#+TITLE: About GNU Mes

#+SUBTITLE: Maxwell Equations of Software

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/mes][GNU Mes]] is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping the GNU
System.  Since version 0.22 it has again helped to halve the size of
opaque, uninspectable binary seeds that are currently being used in the
[[https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2020/guix-further-reduces-bootstrap-seed-to-25][Further Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap]] of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix][GNU Guix]].  The final goal is to
help create a full-source bootstrap as part of the [[https://bootstrappable.org][bootstrappable builds]]
effort for UNIX-like operating systems.

The Scheme interpreter is written in ~5,000 LOC of simple C, and the C
compiler written in Scheme and these are mutual self-hosting.  Mes can
now be bootstrapped from [[https://github.com/oriansj/m2-planet][M2-Planet]] and [[https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/mescc-tools][Mescc-Tools]].

Mes has a Garbage Collector, a library of loadable Scheme modules--
notably Dominique Boucher's [[https://github.com/schemeway/lalr-scm][LALR]], Pre-R6RS [[https://www.cs.indiana.edu/chezscheme/syntax-case/old-psyntax.html][portable syntax-case]] with
R7RS ellipsis, Matt Wette's [[https://www.nongnu.org/nyacc][Nyacc]] --and test suite, just enough to
support a REPL and a C99 compiler: mescc.

Mes + MesCC + Mes C Library can build a [[https://gitlab.com/janneke/tinycc][bootstrappable TinyCC]] that is
self-hosting.  Using this tcc and the Mes C library we now have a
Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap for the gnutools triplet: glibc-2.2.5,
binutils-2.20.1, gcc-2.95.3.  This is enough to bootstrap Guix for
i686-linux, x86_64-linux, armhf-linux and aarch64-linux.

Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: [[https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf][LISP-1.5]] -- John
McCarthy page 13, GNU Guix's source/binary packaging transparency and
Jeremiah Orians's [[https://github.com/oriansj/stage0][stage0]] ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler.

We are very grateful to NLNet for sponsoring the [[https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUMes][Reduced Binary Seed
bootstrap]], the [[https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUMes-arm][ARM port]], and the [[https://nlnet.nl/project/GNUMes-ARM_RISC-V][Full Source Bootstrap.]]
