Subject: GNU Mes 0.24.1 released

<#secure method=pgpmime mode=sign>

We are happy to announce the release of GNU Mes 0.24.1, representing 23
commits over five months by four people.

Mes now supports the stage0-posix and M2-Planet Full Source bootstrap on
Aarch64 for ARM.  Because stage0-posix does not support ARM yet, the Mes
ARM bootstrap is currently prototyped on Aarch64.

We are excited that the NlNet Foundation[4] is again sponsoring this
work!

What's next?

Work to prototype this so-called "Full Source Bootstrap" for ARM on
Aarch64 is happening on the wip-aarch64-bootstrap[3] branch.  Also, full
Guile compatible module support, and RISC-V support.

Enjoy!

* About

  GNU Mes[5] is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping
  the GNU System.  Since version 0.22 it has again helped to halve the
  size of opaque, uninspectable binary seeds that are currently being
  used in the Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap[6] of GNU Guix[7].  The
  final goal is to help create a full source bootstrap as part of the
  bootstrappable builds[8] effort for UNIX-like operating systems.

  The Scheme interpreter is written in ~5,000 LOC of simple C, and the C
  compiler written in Scheme and these are mutual self-hosting.  Mes can
  now be bootstrapped from M2-Planet[9] and Mescc-Tools[10].

  Mes has a Garbage Collector, a library of loadable Scheme modules--
  notably Dominique Boucher's LALR[11], Pre-R6RS portable
  syntax-case[12] with R7RS ellipsis, Matt Wette's Nyacc[13] --and test
  suite, just enough to support a REPL and a C99 compiler: mescc.

  Mes + MesCC + Mes C Library can build a bootstrappable TinyCC[14] that
  is self-hosting.  Using this tcc and the Mes C library we now have a
  Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap for the gnutools triplet: glibc-2.2.5,
  binutils-2.20.1, gcc-2.95.3.  This is enough to bootstrap Guix for
  i686-linux, x86_64-linux, armhf-linux and aarch64-linux.

  Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: LISP-1.5[15] --
  John McCarthy page 13, GNU Guix's source/binary packaging transparency
  and Jeremiah Orians's stage0[16] 357-byte self-hosting hex assembler.

  [*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
  .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
  and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

    gpg --verify mes-0.24.1.tar.gz.sig

  If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
  or that public key has expired, try the following commands to update
  or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.
